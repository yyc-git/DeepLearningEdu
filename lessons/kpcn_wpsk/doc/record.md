no path tracer, use dataset to train and inference directly!


use kpcn resconstruction




train(diffuse, specular separately) + fune-train(complete framework)
    how to tune-train?



convert depth value to range [0,1]

shading normal, word position, and

camera-space depth





shuffled

noised:128spp or 32spp

how to get 400 patches for each 1920 Ã— 1080 frame without uniform sampling?
